        While math is seen as a very pragmatic subject, many of these aims
        are far more conceptual in practice. So when it comes to math, do
        scientific calculators help or hurt understanding of concepts?
        Calculators make complex calculations seem easy to solve.

        The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early
        1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s,
        especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was
        developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They
        later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and
        gas).

        Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away
        credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in
        printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation
        of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of
        that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic
        calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

        Before the advent of scientific calculators, most math classes involved
        a heavy degree of long-form pen-and-pencil arithmetic, algebraic equations
        and a lot of rote memorization. Traditionally, this repetitive practice of
        recording and manipulating the same formulas over and over again was considered
        the best foundation for a future in math.
